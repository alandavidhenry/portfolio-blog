<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio and blog website. This project showcases my work, skills, and thoughts using modern web development technologies and practices.

### Built With

* [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev)
* [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
* [DecapCMS](https://decapcms.org)
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)

#### Eleventy (11ty)

I chose Eleventy as the static site generator for this project due to its flexibility and simplicity. Eleventy allows me to:

- Use the Nunjucks templating language (which I have experience of when working on the MOD Digital website).
- Create a fast, lightweight site with excellent performance out of the box.

#### TailwindCSS

For styling, I opted for TailwindCSS because:

- It provides a utility-first approach, allowing for rapid UI development.
- It's highly customizable, enabling me to create a unique design that reflects my personal brand.
- The built-in purge feature ensures that only the CSS I use is included in the final build, resulting in a smaller file size.

#### Code Quality Tools

To maintain code quality and consistency, I've implemented:

- Prettier for consistent code formatting across the project.
- ESLint with custom configs and airbnb-base for enforcing coding standards and catching potential errors early in the development process.

#### Content Management and Deployment

I integrated DecapCMS headlessCMS to manage my blog posts and portfolio content as it provides a user-friendly interface for content creation and editing, while keeping my content as part of my Git repository.

For deployment I opted for Netlify because it offers:

- Seamless integration with my Git workflow, enabling continuous deployment.
- Built-in CI/CD pipeline that automatically builds and deploys my site when I push changes to GitHub.
- Easy setup for custom domains and SSL certificates.
- Excellent performance with a global CDN.
- Integrates well with DecapCMS and allows sign in using Netlify Identity.
